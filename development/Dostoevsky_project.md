# Research Questions for Computational Dostoevsky: 
# Digitation of Bakhtin’s dialogism

The project would explore Golyadkin’s self-consciousness through quantification of his inner and external dialogue in Dostoevsky’s The Double (Dvoinik), published in 1846. In particular, we would conduct quantitative and qualitative investigations of the dialogic properties of Golyadkin’s dialogue, focusing on an ontological split of his personality: Golyadkin himself, his inner conflicting voice, and a separate body of himself, Golyadkin Junior. The investigation would be done by tagging (direct, indirect, and free indirect) speech instances of Golyadkin’s three voices and descriptions of their traits in the narrations: how often, how long, to whom they speak and how they echo one another.

Mikhail Bakhtin in his book Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics introduced ideas of dialogism and polyphony to literary criticism. He asserts that Dostoevsky innovated a type of polyphonic novels that are characterized by dialogic speech by recognizably different voices of different characters that are fully equal and not subordinate to the authorial or narratorial voice. It allows a plurality of consciousness and affirms multiple points of worldviews. The Double is situated in Dostoevsky’s earlier stage of creating his polyphonic novels. Through our research, we would like to re-examine and develop Bakhtin’s literary analysis of Dostoevsky’s works with the emphasis on self-consciousness or self-reflexiveness of the characters, beginning from The Double. For the further research, the project would develop into the two different directions: analyses of Gogol’s works and their influence on The Double or Dostoevsky’s further development of dialogism and the theme of the double in his later novels, such as The Possessed and The Karamazov Brothers.
