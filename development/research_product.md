# Research Product

## Week of 01/31-02/07
As of right now, Kiun and I are unsure what the final form of the results will take; therefore, this exercise is primarily speculative. Once we begin to encode the document and begin to see what form the results of the project will take, we will be able to decide which visualization forms best suit the quantitative and qualitative narrative of the project. However, if we think of what might be traditionally expected of quantitative text research, we can tentatively plan to have tables detailing the frequency with which the three primary speakers (Golyadkin Senior, Golyadkin Junior, and the narrator) participate in the dialogic discourse of the novel. If we decide to look at the novel chapter-by-chapter, we need to decide if we want to use the inherent structure of the novel (which is divided into parts) or whether to highlight particular passages of time within the novel that have dialogic episodes. If we take this chronological view, it might be beneficial to have a graph that shows how the voices intersect in the novel's narrative space over time, particularly as Golyadkin's schism deepens. This "Research Product" section will be updated over time as the understanding of the project evolves over time, especially as the amount of work done increases.
