        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="inc/menu.xhtml" -->
        <p>The project explores Goliadkin’s self-consciousness through quantification of his
            inner and external dialogue, utilizing Mikhail Bakhtin’s theoretical text
            <em>Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics</em> as a basis for the analysis. In
            this work, Bakhtin introduces ideas of dialogism and polyphony to literary
            criticism, asserting that Dostoevsky innovated a type of polyphonic novel that
            is characterized by dialogic speech acts made by recognizably different voices
            of different characters, each of whom are fully equal and thus not subordinate
            to the authorial or narratorial voice. This dialogic discourse allows a
            plurality of consciousness and affirms multiple points of worldview. Bakhtin
            posits that there are three forms of speech: direct, indirect, and free
            indirect, as well as three forms of emotional valence in Goliadkin’s speech
            acts: timid, self-confident, and mocking.</p>
