        <!--#include virtual="inc/menu.xhtml" -->
        <p> To quantify this dialogic discourse, an XML encoding of the text in the original
            Russian was produced, tagging all instances of speech, as well as their
            attributes (direct vs. indirect, timid vs. self-confident, et cetera); moreover,
            to formalize the encoding, RelaxNG was used to write a schema, ensuring that the
            encoding is not only well-formed, but also adheres to the specifications of our
            analysis. Regular expressions were used to clean the text and to locate
            grammatical indications of speech (angled quotation marks or dashes). Following
            the location of speech acts, each act's attributes were defined. We then counted
            how often each character (Goliadkin, Goliadkin's double, the narrator) engages
            in the three types of speech, as well as how Goliadkin's speech acts shift in
            emotional valence over the course of the work.</p>
