        <!--#include virtual="inc/menu.xhtml" -->
        <p> To quantify this dialogic discourse, an XML encoding of the text in the original Russian
            was produced, tagging all instances of speech, as well as their attributes (speaker,
            addressee, voice type); moreover, to formalize the encoding, RelaxNG was used to write a
            schema, ensuring that the encoding is not only well-formed, but also adheres to the
            specifications of our analysis. Regular expressions were used to clean the text and to
            locate grammatical indications of speech (angled quotation marks or dashes). The text
            was sourced from the following <a href="https://rvb.ru/dostoevski/01text/vol1/02.htm"
                target="_blank">link</a></p>
        <p> Following the location of speech acts, each act's attributes were defined. We then
            counted how often Goliadkin engages in the three speech voicings (timid, confident, and
            mocking), as well as the patterns of his internal and external discourse. The discourse
            of others was analyzed through focusing on the transference of words across characters.
            A combination of XSLT and SVG was used to generate the visualizations, and XSLT was
            further used to transform the XML encoding of the text into the full view of <em>The
                Double</em> found on the "Text" page.</p>
