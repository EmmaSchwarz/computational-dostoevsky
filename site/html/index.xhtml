                <!--<p> First published in 1846, Fyodor Dostoevsky's <em>The Double</em>
                        [<em>Двойник</em>] chronicles the mind of Yakov Petrovich Goliadkin—a
                    Petersburg titular councillor—as he is confronted by a living mirror image of
                    himself; moreover, this mirror image possesses all the qualities Goliadkin deems
                    lacking in himself. The original Goliadkin is referred to as Goliadkin Senior
                        [<em>Голядкин-старший</em>], while his double is referenced as Goliadkin
                    Junior [<em>Голядкин-младший</em>]. Where Goliadkin Senior lacks confidence and
                    performs poorly in social situations, Goliadkin Junior is charming and quickly
                    outperforms his Senior at their place of work. The appearance of the titular
                    double occurs following a social experience so humiliating, Goliadkin states
                    that "Mr. Goliadkin was killed—killed entirely, in the full sense of the word"
                        [<em>«Господин Голядкин был убит—убит вполне, в полном смысле слова»</em>]:
                    in this rejection of the self, Goliadkin's consciousness manifests an alternate,
                    superior version of the self, Goliadkin Junior. By the end of the story,
                    Goliadkin's self-consciousness shatters further, and he begins to feel
                    surrounded by other manifestations of himself; the story ends with his journey
                    to an asylum. </p>-->
                <!--<p>The project explores Goliadkin’s self-consciousness through quantification of his
                    inner and external dialogue, utilizing Mikhail Bakhtin’s theoretical text
                        <em>Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics</em> as a basis for the analysis. In
                    this work, Bakhtin introduces ideas of dialogism and polyphony to literary
                    criticism, asserting that Dostoevsky innovated a type of polyphonic novel that
                    is characterized by dialogic speech acts made by recognizably different voices
                    of different characters, each of whom are fully equal and thus not subordinate
                    to the authorial or narratorial voice. This dialogic discourse allows a
                    plurality of consciousness and affirms multiple points of worldview. Bakhtin
                    posits that there are three forms of speech: direct, indirect, and free
                    indirect, as well as three forms of emotional valence in Goliadkin’s speech
                    acts: timid, self-confident, and mocking.</p>
                <p> To quantify this dialogic discourse, an XML encoding of the text in the original
                    Russian was produced, tagging all instances of speech, as well as their
                    attributes (direct vs. indirect, timid vs. self-confident, et cetera); moreover,
                    to formalize the encoding, RelaxNG was used to write a schema, ensuring that the
                    encoding is not only well-formed, but also adheres to the specifications of our
                    analysis. Regular expressions were used to clean the text and to locate
                    grammatical indications of speech (angled quotation marks or dashes). Following
                    the location of speech acts, each act's attributes were defined. We then counted
                    how often each character (Goliadkin, Goliadkin's double, the narrator) engages
                    in the three types of speech, as well as how Goliadkin's speech acts shift in
                    emotional valence over the course of the work.</p>
                <p>Through our research, we would like to re-examine and develop Bakhtin’s literary
                    analysis of Dostoevsky’s works, with an emphasis on self-consciousness or
                    self-reflexiveness of the characters, beginning with <em>The Double</em>. For
                    further research, the project would develop in two different directions:
                    analyses of Gogol’s works and their influence on <em>The Double</em>, or
                    analyses of Dostoevsky’s further development of dialogism and the theme of the
                    double in his later novels, such as <em>The Possessed</em> and <em>The Karamazov
                        Brothers</em>. Information on the project can be found on <a
