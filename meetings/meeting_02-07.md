## Steps 
* Start a schema 
* Start encoding as quickly as possible
* Make an issue to discuss the schema (agree on components)
* Come in next week with at least a rough schema
* Formalize mark-up for Bakhtinian dialogic discourse
* Maybe divide schema and mark-up
* First schema, then mark-up a section to test the schema/troubleshoot
* See how long mark-up takes to gauge project scope
