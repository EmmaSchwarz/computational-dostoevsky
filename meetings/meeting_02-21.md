## Dostoevsky Project Meeting
#Feb 21st, 2000
#Emma, Kiun, Mitchell 

-Progress of this week: 
Reading through the primary text more, we realized there is less consistence in structure of dialogues and narrative in the speech. We are a bit hesitant in inviting tools without further conceptualizing our specific goal of the project 

-Starts with standardized headers or standardized conclusions that can work with the regular expressions, such as a hyphen and a  
-Be aware about when we could complete the project since it is the end of February. Need to start moving, since Dostoevskii’s the Double is quite long. 
-Testing Bakhtin’s claim, we can focus on the chapters that Bakhtin mentioned in his book. 
-for some of dialogues, the regular expression «.+?» will auto-tag many of them will find many of them. Even though it does not capture the whole, it will make the process easier. 
-But this expression involves the following issues.
-It could make random tags
-The case of speech within speech, and the case of quotation marks that were not used for speech require manual tagging anyway. 
-There are 200 close and opening quotes but the regex «.+?» does not return the same number. We found the possible typos or mistakes in digital version of the book. Take into consideration that there could be some errors in the online text.

-for next week, think more about what you want to tag and what we can regex or not. 
-Many attributes can delay the process of the project. Sort out the significant things that are necessary. 
-whether we should differentiate the tags between speech wrapped in hyphens and quotation marks. Would it be affective to our project?
-Shall we consider monologue like ”говорить про себя” as speech? Yes, this is the important part of this project.
-Try to use github project board more.

-Next week:
Make auto-tagging done, using the regex. For further plan, in March we could complete tagging manually which require more time. The last two weeks of the semester could be dedicated to visualization of the text and our analysis.
