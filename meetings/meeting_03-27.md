# Meeting Notes 03/27/20

## Progress 
* Emma: Handling the design of the site, decide between wireframing, or just building it. 
* Emma & Kiun: Decide the exact layout of the site, what individual pages will contain
* Kiun: Modified schema to adhere to markup of text, now that we know exactly which forms appear 
* Kiun: Marked up the first part of the text 
* Emma: Marking (still) up the second part of the text 

## What to Do Next
* Both: Formalize expectations for the site 
* Validate the two parts of the text 
* Think about how to visualize research findings from the markup
* Charts vs graphs etc. 
* How does the visualization enchance the research goals? 
* Kiun: Working on the mapping of Goliadkin's walk through Petersburg in Chapter Four
    * Making the mapping interactive through QGIS, so that individual locations of Goliadkin in the chapter can be linked to the text associated with that location, also highlighting the voicing(s) present at that moment
* Emma: Finishing the site layout, so that pages are ready to be populated with finalized information/visualizations
