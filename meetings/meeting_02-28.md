# 02/28/2020 Meeting

## Progress 
* Encoded all instances of non-nested quoted and dashed speech
* Removed unpaired quotes (both of which were errors in the digital copy)
* Committed all changes to Github

## To-Do for Next Week (03/06/2020)
* Tag the nested speech instances
* Make sure that the letters have milestone ```<p>``` tags, allowing for speech instances within the letters to be tagged (we don't want speech instances to begin in one paragraph, then end in another; this is not well-formed.
* Begin on the website's homepage, with information on the project and its methodology displayed
