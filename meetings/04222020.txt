Emma continues to work on the stylization of the website: to make sure that the links are working and make the text page functions available to find the speeches spoken by the different voices in the whole text. 
Kiun (with David) completed the stacked bar chart. Kiun will revised the mark-ups of the second-half of the text for the charts since free indirect Goliadkin's speeches in the narrations should be tagged and there are mistakes in marking the voice attributes. 
The next meeting will be held tommorrow at 6.
